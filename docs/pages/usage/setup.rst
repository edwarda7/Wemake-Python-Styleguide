Setup
=====

Remember that ``wemake-python-styleguide`` is just a ``flake8`` plugin.

.. _usage:

Running
-------

To run our linter you will need to run ``flake8`` in any way you like:

.. code:: bash

    flake8 your_module.py
    flake8 your_package

See the ``flake8`` docs for `options <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html>`_
and `usage examples <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/invocation.html>`_.

Golden rule is to run your linter on each commit locally and inside the CI.
And to fail the build if there are any style violations.

Ignoring violations
-------------------

We know that people might not agree with 100% of our rules.
But we still want to provide the best experience for all users.

So, you can disable some checks, that you are not ok with.
**Note**: you might accidentally break the consistency of this project,
when you disable some checks. We **do not** officially recommend to do it.

There are three ways to ignore some specific violations:

1. Inline ignore with ``# noqa:`` comment and comma separated violation codes
2. Command line argument ``--ignore`` with comma separated violation codes
3. Configuration line inside ``setup.cfg`` or ``tox.ini``, `example <https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/blob/master/setup.cfg#L23-L36>`_

You can ignore:

1. Whole ``WPS`` letters, this will completely turn off all our custom checks
2. Some specific group (naming, complexity, consistency, best practices, etc)
   with ``WPS`` and the first number of this group
3. Some specific violation with the full violation code

Use `per-file-ignores <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html?highlight=per-file-ignores#cmdoption-flake8-per-file-ignores>`_
option, so it is possible to ignore violations on a per-file bases.
It means, that you can have different set of violations
ignored for different files.

Read more about `ignoring violations <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/violations.html>`_
in the official docs.
